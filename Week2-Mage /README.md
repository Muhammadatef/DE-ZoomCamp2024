# Week 2: Workflow Orchestration

Welcome to Week 2 of the Data Engineering Zoomcamp! ðŸš€ðŸ˜¤ This week, we'll be covering workflow orchestration with Mage.

Mage is an open-source, hybrid framework for transforming and integrating data. âœ¨

This week, you'll learn how to use the Mage platform to author and share magical data pipelines. This will all be covered in the course, but if you'd like to learn a bit more about Mage, check out our [docs here](https://docs.mage.ai).
